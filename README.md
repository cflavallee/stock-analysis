# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
In order to find the best performaing green stocks from 2017 & 2018, Python code was used to evaluate performance.  This project could also be extended to additional stocks or the stock market as a whole. The refactoring code allowed for faster run times, enabling quicker analysis of various stocks. 

## Results
After refactoring the Module 2 code, the script ran twice as fast (See screenshots below).

This was done mainly through two modifications.  First, all data was store in arrays prior to outputting the results in the analysis sheet.  Second, an Exit For was added after the Ending Price was populated, so there was no need to continue looping through the rows. Additionally, some redundant code was removed.  

## Summary

### Benefits 
The benefits of refactoring the code included having a quicker run time for the script as well as making the code a bit easier to read and understand. 

### Challenges
The main disadvantage was in the time it took to try new lnes of code and sequences.  It may not always be beneifcial to rework code that is effective.
